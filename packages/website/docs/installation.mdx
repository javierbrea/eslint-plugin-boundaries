# Installation

ESLint Plugin Boundaries is distributed via npm which is bundled with node. It should be added to your project's `devDependencies`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-boundaries
```

:::note
`eslint-plugin-boundaries` does **not** install `eslint` automatically. You must install it yourself.
:::

Once installed, enable the plugin and apply one of the [predefined configs](./setup/setup.md) in your `eslint.config.js` file:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="JavaScript">

```javascript
import boundaries from "eslint-plugin-boundaries";

export default [
  {
    plugins: {
      boundaries,
    },
    rules: {
      ...boundaries.configs.recommended.rules,
    }
  }
];
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">

```typescript
import boundaries, { Config } from "eslint-plugin-boundaries";

export default [
  {
    plugins: {
      boundaries,
    },
    rules: {
      ...boundaries.configs.recommended.rules,
    },
  } satisfies Config
];
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning Eslint Version Compatibility
Starting from version `5.0.0`, this plugin is compatible with ESLint **v9 and above**.
While it may still work with earlier versions of ESLint, refer to the
[documentation for version `4.2.2`](https://github.com/javierbrea/eslint-plugin-boundaries/tree/v4.2.2) if you need to configure it using the legacy format.
