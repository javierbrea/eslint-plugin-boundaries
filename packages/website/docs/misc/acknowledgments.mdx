### Users and Advocates

**Thank you to everyone using this plugin in their projects.** By choosing to enforce architectural boundaries in your codebase, you're helping to prove that maintainable architecture matters. Your adoption validates the effort behind this project.

A special thanks to those who share their experiences, write blog posts, give talks, or simply recommend the plugin to others. You help spread the word and grow our community. Every star on GitHub, every mention on social media, and every recommendation in a code review helps others discover the value of architectural boundaries.

## Technical Foundation

This project stands on the shoulders of other great open source work.

### Core Dependencies

**eslint-plugin-import**  
This plugin uses the `eslint-module-utils/resolve` module, which is part of [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import). Huge thanks to the maintainers of that plugin for their excellent work on module resolution—it's what makes this plugin robust and flexible.

## Quote Attribution

**Opening Quote**  
The opening quote about software architecture boundaries is from Robert C. Martin's book [_"Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design"_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-architecture-a/9780134494272/).
