# Quick Start

Follow these steps to quickly set up ESLint Plugin Boundaries in your project. Then you can explore more advanced configurations to fit your project's needs in the [Setup section](./setup/setup.md).


## 1. Installation

If you [haven't already](./installation.mdx), install ESLint and ESLint Plugin Boundaries:

```bash
npm install eslint eslint-plugin-boundaries --save-dev
```

## 2. Register the Plugin

Once installed, enable the plugin in your `eslint.config.js` file:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="JavaScript">

```javascript
import boundaries from "eslint-plugin-boundaries";

export default [
  {
    plugins: {
      boundaries,
    },
  }
];
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">

```typescript
import boundaries, { Config } from "eslint-plugin-boundaries";

export default [
  {
    plugins: {
      boundaries,
    },
  } satisfies Config
];
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 3. Define your Element Types

The plugin needs to be able to identify the elements in the project, so, first of all you have to define your project element types by using the `boundaries/elements` setting.

It will use the provided patterns to identify each file or dependency as one of the element types.

:::tip
Read the [Elements](./setup/elements.md) section for guidance on how to define the patterns for the elements in your project.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="JavaScript">

<CodeDiff language="javascript">{`
. import boundaries from "eslint-plugin-boundaries";

. export default [
.   {
.     plugins: {
.       boundaries,
.     },
+     settings: {
+       "boundaries/elements": [
+         { type: "controllers", pattern: "controllers/*" },
+         { type: "models", pattern: "models/*" },
+         { type: "views", pattern: "views/*" }
+       ],
+     },
.   }
. ];
`}</CodeDiff>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">

<CodeDiff language="typescript">{`
. import boundaries, { Config, Settings } from "eslint-plugin-boundaries";

. export default [
.   {
.     plugins: {
.       boundaries,
.     },
+     settings: {
+       "boundaries/elements": [
+         { type: "controllers", pattern: "controllers/*" },
+         { type: "models", pattern: "models/*" },
+         { type: "views", pattern: "views/*" }
+       ],
+     } satisfies Settings,
.   } satisfies Config
. ];
`}</CodeDiff>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
This is only a basic example of configuration. The plugin can be configured to identify elements being a file, or elements being a folder containing files. It also supports capturing path fragments to be used afterwards on each rule, etc.
:::

## 4. Apply Predefined Rules

Apply one of the [predefined rules configuration](./setup/setup.md) as a starting point by extending it in the `rules` section.

:::tip
You should use `recommended` config in already existing projects to gradually introduce the rules without too many errors at once, because it does not require all files in the project to belong to an element type. For new projects, you can use `strict` config to ensure all files belong to an element type from the beginning.

<CodeDiff language="javascript">{`
. import boundaries from "eslint-plugin-boundaries";

. export default [
.   {
.     plugins: {
.       boundaries,
.     },
.     settings: {
.       "boundaries/elements": [
.         { type: "controllers", pattern: "controllers/*" },
.         { type: "models", pattern: "models/*" },
.         { type: "views", pattern: "views/*" }
.       ],
.     },
+     rules: {
+       ...boundaries.configs.recommended.rules,
+     },
.   },
. ];
`}</CodeDiff>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">

<CodeDiff language="typescript">{`
. import boundaries, { Config, Settings, Rules } from "eslint-plugin-boundaries";

. export default [
.   {
.     plugins: {
.       boundaries,
.     },
.     settings: {
.       "boundaries/elements": [
.         { type: "controllers", pattern: "controllers/*" },
.         { type: "models", pattern: "models/*" },
.         { type: "views", pattern: "views/*" }
.       ],
.     } satisfies Settings,

+       ...boundaries.configs.recommended.rules,
+     } satisfies Rules,
.   } satisfies Config
. ];
`}</CodeDiff>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 5. Set Dependency Rules

Now you can define your own dependency rules by using the `boundaries/element-types` rule.

:::tip
Read the [Element Types Rule](./rules/dependencies.md) docs for guidance on how to customize the dependency rules for your project.

## 6. Next Steps

You are all set! Now you can start enforcing architectural boundaries in your project 🎉

But this was only the beginning, now you can:

- Explore the **[Setup section](./setup/setup.md)** to learn more about **assigning Element Types and using Element Selectors to match them in rules**.
- Check the **[Rules section](./rules/overview/overview.md)** to learn about **all the available rules and how to configure them**.
- Read the **[Error Messages section](./rules/overview/error-messages.md)** to understand **the meaning of each error message**, or customize them to your needs.
