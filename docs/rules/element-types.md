# boundaries/element-types

> Check allowed dependencies between element types

## Rule details

It checks `import` statements between the element types of the project based on the provided options rules.

### Options

```
"boundaries/element-types": [<enabled>, { "default": <string>, "message": <string>, "rules": <object> }]
```

* `enabled`: for enabling the rule. 0=off, 1=warn, 2=error.
* `default`: `allow` or `disallow`. If no one `rule` matches, the dependency will be allowed or disallowed based on this value.
* `message`: Custom message for the rule errors. Note that __the rule default message provides a lot of information about why the error was produced__, so you should define a custom message only if you are sure about what you are doing. Read ["error messages"](#error-messages) for further information.
* `rules`: Rules to be processed in order to decide if the `import` statement has to be allowed or not. It must be an array of objects containing:
  * `from`: `<element selectors>` If the file being analyzed matches with this, then the rule will be executed to know if it allows/disallows the `import`. If not, the rule is skipped.
  * `disallow`: `<element selectors>` If the element being imported matches with this, then the result of the rule will be "disallow", and the import will be notified as an `eslint` error (this value can be overwritten by a next rule returning "allow")
  * `allow`: `<element selectors>` If the element being imported matches with this, then the result of the rule will be "allow", and the import will not be notified as an `eslint` error (this value can be overwritten by a next rule returning "disallow")
  * `importKind`: `<string>` Optional. It is useful only when using TypeScript, as it allows to define if the rule applies when the dependency is being imported as a value or as a type. It can be also defined as an array of strings, or a micromatch pattern. Note that possible values to match with are `"value"`, `"type"` or `"typeof"`.
  * `message`: `<string>` Custom error message only for this rule. Read ["error messages"](#error-messages) for further info.

##### Comparing captures of the file element with captures of the imported element

As a bonus of this rule, the `<capturedValuesObject>` option of the "element selectors" in the `allow`/`disallow` properties supports replacements with the captured values of the `from` element. It sounds complicated, but it can be easy to understand with an example:

Suppose you want that helpers of one category can only import helpers of the same category. Then, you need to compare the value of the `category` captured in `from` with the value of the `category` captured in `allow`. You can use the special pattern `${capturedKey}` in the `allow` options, and it will be replaced by the correspondent captured key in `from` before using `micromatch` to check if the value matches.

So, if the `from` element has captured values `{ family: "atom", elementName: "component-a" }`, then the next element selector in the `allow` property: `["helpers", { "category": "!${family}-${elementName}" }]` will only match if the helper captured category has a value matching `"!atom-component-a"` _(which may has not sense at all, but is useful to illustrate how the replacement works. An example with a more useful usage of this feature can be seen in the next options example)_

> Tip: You can enable the [debug mode](../../README.md#debug-mode) when configuring the plugin, and you will get information about the type assigned and captured values from each file in the project.

##### Options example

```jsonc
{
  "rules": {
    "boundaries/element-types": [2, {
        // disallow all local imports by default
        "default": "disallow",
        "rules": [
          {
            // from helper elements
            "from": ["helpers"],
            // allow importing helper elements
            "allow": ["helpers"],
            // allow only importing value, not type. Useful only in TypeScript
            "importKind": "value"
          },
          {
            // from component elements
            "from": ["components"],
            "allow": [
              // allow importing components of the same family
              ["components", { "family": "${family}" }],
              // allow importing helpers with captured category "data"
              ["helpers", { "category": "data" }]
            ]
          },
          {
            // from components with captured family "molecule"
            "from": [["components", { "family": "molecule" }]],
            "allow": [
              // allow importing components with captured family "atom"
              ["components", { "family": "atom" }]
            ]
          },
          {
            // from modules
            "from": ["modules"],
            // allow importing helpers, components and modules
            "allow": ["helpers", "components", "modules"]
          },
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

      {
        "type": "helpers",
        "pattern": "helpers/*/*.js",
        "mode": "file",
        "capture": ["category", "elementName"]
      },

        "pattern": "components/*/*",
        "mode": "folder",
        "capture": ["family", "elementName"]
      },
      {
        "type": "modules",
        "pattern": "modules/*",
        "mode": "folder",
        "capture": ["elementName"]
      }
    ],
    "import/resolver": {
      "babel-module": {}
    }
  }
}
```

> Next examples are written as is the project has configured babel aliases for folders `src/helpers`, `src/components` and `src/modules`. This is made for better readability of the examples, but it would work also with relative paths. You can configure the plugin to recognize babel aliases [using `eslint-import-resolver-babel-module` as a resolver](../../README.md#resolvers), as you can see in the settings example.

### Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

_Helpers can't import components:_

```js
// src/helpers/permissions/roles.js
import AtomA from 'components/atoms/atom-a'
```

_Helpers can't import type from helpers:_

```js
// src/helpers/permissions/roles.js
import type { SomeParser } from 'helpers/data/parse'
```

_Helpers can't import modules:_

```js
// src/helpers/permissions/roles.js
import ModuleA from 'modules/module-a'
```

_Components can't import components of another family:_

```js
// src/components/atoms/atom-a/AtomA.js
import MoleculeA from 'components/molecules/molecule-a'
```

_Components can't import helpers of a category different to "data":_

```js
// src/components/atoms/atom-a/AtomA.js
import { roleHasPermissions } from 'helpers/permissions/roles'
```

_Components can't import modules:_

```js
// src/components/atoms/atom-a/AtomA.js
import ModuleA from 'modules/module-a'
```

### Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

_Helpers can import helpers:_

```js
// src/helpers/permissions/roles.js
import { someParser } from 'helpers/data/parse'
```

_Components can import components of the same family:_

```js
// src/components/atoms/atom-a/AtomA.js
import AtomB from 'components/atoms/atom-b'
```

_Components can import helpers of "data" category:_

```js
// src/components/atoms/atom-a/AtomA.js
import { someParser } from 'helpers/data/parse'
```

_Components of family "molecule" can import components of family "atom":_

```js
// src/components/molecules/molecule-a/MoleculeA.js
import AtomA from 'components/atoms/atoms-a'
```

_Modules can import helpers:_

```js
// src/modules/module-a/ModuleA.js
import { someParser } from 'helpers/data/parse'
```

_Modules can import components:_

```js
// src/modules/module-a/ModuleA.js
import AtomA from 'components/atoms/atom-a'
```

_Modules can import another modules:_

```js
// src/modules/module-a/ModuleA.js
import ModuleB from 'modules/module-b'
```

### Error messages

This rule provides a lot of information about the specific option producing an error, so the user can have enough context to solve it.

* If the error is produced because all imports are disallowed by default, and no rule is specifically allowing it, then the message provides information about the file and the dependency types and captured values: `No rule allowing this dependency was found. File is of type 'components' with category 'molecules' and elementName 'molecule-c'. Dependency is of type 'modules' with domain 'domain-a' and elementName 'module-a'`.
* If the error is produced by a specific option, then the message includes information about the option producing it: `Importing elements of type 'components' with category 'atoms' and elementName '*-a' is not allowed in elements of type 'helpers' with elementName 'helper-c'. Disallowed in rule 1`
* If the rule contains an `importKind` property, then the message also includes information about the import kind: `Importing kind "value" from elements of type 'components' with category 'atoms' and elementName '*-a' as 'value' is not allowed in elements of type 'helpers' with elementName 'helper-c'. Disallowed in rule 1`

You can also configure a custom error message for changing this default behavior, or even custom error messages only for a specific rule option. Read ["error messages"](../../README.md#error-messages) in the main docs for further info about how to configure messages.
